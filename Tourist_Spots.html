      Kiritimati is a stunning coral island, nestled within the Northern Line Islands of the Pacific Ocean. It boosts the distinction of being the largest coral atoll in the world, with an expanse of approximately 388 square kilometres. Its expansive lagoon mirrors the island's land area, creating a paradise of azure waters that stretch as far as the eye can see.

        Tarawa is an atoll and the capital of the Republic of Kiribati, in the central Pacific Ocean. It comprises North Tarawa, which has much in common with other, more remote islands of the Gilberts group; and South Tarawa, which is home to 50,182 as of 2010 – half of the country’s total population. The atoll is best known by outsiders as the site of the Battle of Tarawa during World War II. Tarawa has a large lagoon, 500 square kilometres (193 sq mi) total area, and a wide reef. Although naturally abundant in fish and shellfish of all kinds, marine resources are being strained by the large and growing population. Drought is frequent, but in normal years rainfall is sufficient to maintain breadfruit, papaya and banana trees as well as coconut and pandanus.
